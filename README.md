# ðŸ“¦ What's in the box?!

I started researching different approaches to bundling assets when building websites with the 11ty Static Site Generator. After reading through some articles online I was reminded of [Laravel Mix](https://laravel-mix.com/).

Mix is an awesome tool, a wrapper around Webpack, it gives developers the ability to bundle assets with very little configuration. It's API also gives you the ability to add extra configuration to webpack, so you get a great level of flexibility.

When testing out Mix, I learned that Mix will compile Vue components out of the box. So this got me thinking, how can I sprinkle Vue components in a 11ty website? It turns out you can do it rather effectively.
